## How to run?


- You can unzip the submitted zip file `Sedhain_Anup.zip` or download the repository using `git clone git@github.com:npsedhain/gator-ticket-master.git`

- Change directory to `gator-ticket-master` locally and run `make`

- You should see a binary file being created in the directory with the name: `gatorTicketMaster`, then you can run `./gatorTicketMaster <input_file.txt>`

- Alternatively, you can also simply run `python3 gatorTicketMaster.py <input_file.txt>`



## Program Structure

### `gatorTicketMaster.py`

The program starts at `gatorTicketMaster.py` which reads the input file and parses each line and prints out the output depending upon the input commands.

It calls the `TicketMaster` class which has the overall implementation of the program.

```
ticket_master  =  TicketMaster()
```

The `process_command` method is called which then parses and runs each line as prints the output. This file acts like a black box that hides all the implementation details within the class `TicketMaster`.
```
result  =  process_command(ticket_master, line)
```

### `TicketMaster.py` Class Overview

This class defines each method implemented for the program. It is also responsible for returning the correct responses according to the project draft.

Since all the implementation procedures were defined in the project draft, only the overview is stated here.

Let's look at the class variables that save the object's state at any given time.

```
def  __init__(self):
	self.reserved_seats  =  RedBlackTree() # Maps user_id to seat_id
	self.waitlist  =  BinaryMinHeap() # Priority queue for waiting users
	self.available_seats  =  BinaryMinHeap() # Heap for available seat numbers
	self.seat_to_user  = {} # Quick lookup for seat to user mapping
	self.max_seat_number  =  0  # Keep track of highest seat number
```

When we initialize the number of seats, we create instances of the two important data structures written from scratch for this project. Here's the part of the `initialize(self, seat_count)` method below:

```
# Reset all data structures
self.reserved_seats  =  RedBlackTree()
self.waitlist  =  BinaryMinHeap()
self.available_seats  =  BinaryMinHeap()
self.seat_to_user  = {}
```


### `BinaryMinHeap.py` Class Overview

The `BinaryMinHeap` class implements a priority queue using a binary min-heap data structure to manage waitlist entries and available seats efficiently. Below is a description of the class methods and functionality.

Let's first look at the `HeapNode` and its variables.
```
class  HeapNode:
	def  __init__(self, priority, user_id, timestamp):
		self.priority  =  priority
		self.user_id  =  user_id
		self.timestamp  =  timestamp
```

**Class Variables**:
   - `heap`: Stores `HeapNode` elements in a list format.
   - `position`: Dictionary mapping `user_id` to its index within the heap for quick lookup.

**Methods**:
   - **parent, left_child, right_child**: Helper methods to calculate the indices of parent and child nodes.
   - **swap**: Swaps two nodes in the heap and updates their positions in `position`.
   - **heapify_up**: Bubbles up a node based on priority, maintaining the heap property.
   - **heapify_down**: Pushes a node down to restore heap order after deletion or insertion.
   - **insert**: Adds a `HeapNode` to the heap, adjusts position, and applies `heapify_up`.
   - **extract_max**: Removes and returns the highest-priority element, restructuring the heap afterward.
   - **update_priority**: Changes a node's priority, performing `heapify_up` or `heapify_down` to maintain order.
   - **remove**: Deletes a node by replacing it with the last element and reordering the heap.
   - **is_empty, size, contains**: Utility methods to check heap status and user presence.

This structure allows `BinaryMinHeap` to manage waitlists or available seats with priority-based organization efficiently, supporting quick inserts, deletions, and priority updates.


### `RedBlackTree.py` Class Overview

The `RedBlackTree` class is implemented to manage seat reservations efficiently by associating `user_id` and `seat_id`. This structure ensures balanced insertion and deletion operations.

#### Class Components

1. **RBNode Class**:
   - Represents each node in the Red-Black Tree.
   - **Attributes**: `user_id`, `seat_id`, `left`, `right`, `parent`, and `color`.
   - New nodes are initially red, maintaining Red-Black Tree properties after insertion.

2. **Constructor (`__init__`)**:
   - Initializes an empty tree with a `NIL` node to represent leaf nodes, ensuring balanced behavior.

3. **Rotations** (`left_rotate` and `right_rotate`):
   - Essential for balancing the tree after insertion or deletion. Rotations help in maintaining the Red-Black Tree properties, ensuring O(log n) time complexity for operations.

4. **Insertion (`insert`)**:
   - Inserts a node based on `user_id` as the key and applies `fix_insert` to maintain Red-Black properties, adjusting node colors and performing rotations as needed.

5. **Fix-Up for Insertion (`fix_insert`)**:
   - Ensures Red-Black properties post-insertion. This function changes node colors or rotates the tree based on the colors of a node's parent and uncle.

6. **Deletion (`delete`)**:
   - Deletes a node by linking it with a successor and applying `fix_delete` to rebalance the tree.

7. **Fix-Up for Deletion (`fix_delete`)**:
   - Adjusts colors and performs rotations if necessary to maintain the Red-Black properties after node removal.

8. **Helper Methods**:
   - **`transplant`**: Replaces a subtree with another during deletion.
   - **`minimum`**: Finds the smallest node, used for determining successors during deletion.
   - **`search`**: Finds a node by `user_id`, returning `None` if not found.
   - **`inorder_traverse`**: Collects the tree nodes in ascending order by seat ID, helping to list current reservations.

This structure enables efficient seat management by ensuring all operations—insertions, deletions, and lookups—run in balanced time.
